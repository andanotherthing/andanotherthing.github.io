<div style="font-style: italic;">
<p>
when making staging into production's what you're thinking<br/>
when you're hungry, tired, and stinking<br/>
don't turn staging into production</p>

<p>when reaching the end of your sprint<br/>
and it's likely that you need a mint<br/>
don't turn staging into production</p>

<p>when you want to look out a window<br/>
while converging the versions you're pinned to<br/>
don't turn staging into production</p>

<p>when tears are falling, drip drop<br/>
onto the trackpad and keys of your laptop<br/>
don't turn staging into production</p>

<p>when your diet is too high in calories<br/>
and your tests are exposing code maladies<br/>
don't turn staging into production</p>

<p>when the VP has signed your team up to fail<br/>
and you're afraid of checking your email<br/>
don't turn staging into production</p>

<p>when your project manager is sweating<br/>
and pressure is all that you're getting<br/>
don't turn staging into production</p>

<p>do the right thing<br/>
it's not you who will sting<br/>
don't turn staging into production</p>
</div>
